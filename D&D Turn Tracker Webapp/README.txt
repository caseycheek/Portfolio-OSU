Project Name: D&D Turn Tracker Webapp

Class: CS340 - Introduction to Databases

Requirement Summary:
	Develop a web-based application with full CRUD functionality that is backed by a relational database. Users will be able to view and manipulate data within your database and those changes will persist.

Project Description: 
	In the game Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), players experience two basic forms of play: freeform role-playing sections based around storytelling and world building, and sections of turn-based combat, known as encounters. While D&D campaigns vary greatly in length, most contain several encounters. Small campaigns may have 5 or less while longer games can play through 30-100 encounters. One can imagine how it can be difficult for a Dungeon Master (DM) to manage multiple characters (3-15) through these action-filled combat scenarios. A database-driven, turn-managing website can make this process easier.
	Our D&D Turn Tracker allows a DM to keep track of the turn order of Characters during combat Encounters, show which Characters are affected by Conditions, as well as help them keep track of any special Items held by the Characters.
	A more detailed description of our database design, including screenshots of our webapp in action, can be found in CS340_Project_Report.pdf
