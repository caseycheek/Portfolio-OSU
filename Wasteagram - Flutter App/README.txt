Project Name: Wasteagram
Author: Casey Cheek
Date: 3/11/2022
Class: CS492 - Mobile Application Development

Requirements Summary:
Implement Wasteagram, a mobile Flutter app that enables coffee shop employees to document daily food waste in the form of "posts" consisting of a photo, number of leftover items, the current date, and the location of the device when the post is created. The application should also display a list of all previous posts. In general, it should look like the sketch depicted in the UX Flow pdf.

Extra Credit Requirements:
- The app bar of the List Screen should display the total sum of the number of wasted items in all posts
- Integrate the use of crash reporting (Sentry or Crashlytics) to record application crashes
- Integrate the use of in-app analytics (Firebase Analytics) to monitor application usage

Project Description:
This project meets the above requirements while applying the concepts of location services, camera/image picker, permissions, forms, navigation, lists, asynchronous programming, streams, and Firebase backend services.
