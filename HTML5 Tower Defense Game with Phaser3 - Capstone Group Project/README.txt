Project Description:
This is a single player HTML5 web-based tower defense game written in Javascript using Node.js and the Phaser3 game framework.  To complete each of the three levels, the player must defend a central tower against 10 waves of enemies.  Different enemy types have different abilities, and the most difficult opponents appear in later waves.  Players can both shoot manually from the tower gun and they can place turrets on the map that fire automatically.  There are different kinds of ammunition that complement how the player wants to interact with the game, creating a unique experience for all users.
